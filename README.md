# Language-Creator
This script generates a random story in a randomly created language.

This is an interactive Python script.

Right now some options are not implemented, and it would be difficult to do anything other than create a random story using the default characters / phoneme frequencies / etc.

It should work on linux with any tex interpreter which can pdflatex.

It makes semi-gibberish for now; the way words are constructed from sounds is not fully natural, but learning what 'natural' means there is part of the fun of doing this.  So, more soon.

ChangeLog:

update 1: changed the way wrods are constructed to flow more naturally between vowels and consonants.  Still work to be done on, i.e., starting words with 'rs' or other equivalent weirdnessess.
