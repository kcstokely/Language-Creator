# Language-Creator
This script generates a random story in a randomly created language.

This is an interactive Python script.

Right now you can only create a random story, and only using the default characters / phoneme frequencies / etc.

It should work on linux with any tex interpreter which can pdflatex.

It makes gibberish for now; the way words are constructed from sounds is not very natural, but learning what 'natural' means there is part of the fun of doing this.  So, more soon.
